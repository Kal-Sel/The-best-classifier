# The-best-classifier

In this project, I've completed a notebook where I have build a classifier to predict whether a loan case will be paid off or not.
I've loaded a historical dataset from previous loan applications, cleaned the data, and applied different classification algorithms on the data. 
I was expected to use the following algorithms to build my models:
* k-Nearest Neighbour
* Decision Tree
* Support Vector Machine
* Logistic Regression

The results is reported as the accuracy of each classifier, using the following metrics when these are applicable:
* Jaccard index
* F1-score
* LogLoss
